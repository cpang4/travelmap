Travel Map of my previous trips to various cities - Amsterdam, Berlin, Brussels, Prague, Rotterdam, Taipei, & Tokyo.   
(More are being added soon!)   
Click on a marker for pictures I took at those locations.   

_Two versions - using Google Maps API and Mapbox API_

MapBox: [https://cpang4.github.io/travelmap/mapbox](https://cpang4.github.io/travelmap/mapbox)

The quick java program I wrote that I use to format (manually add) to the GeoJSON is available in this repo as [_Formatter.java_](https://github.com/cpang4/travelmap/blob/master/Formatter.java).
